# Peak 8 Connected Github Page

Peak 8 Connected has developed a number of different products and services, some of which are freely available and some which are developed privately. Information and useful links for several of these project are made available through this site.

ToDo: a whole bunch of stuff. But first create a privay policy for Wavee Configurator.

# Wavee Touchless Switch

The Wavee Touchless Switch is a device that is designed to be mounted near automated physical access points such as doors and turnstiles, or even traffic control centers such as traffec intersections. It uses 60GHz radar to detect motion or presence and then activates a relay and LCD. It also includes a Bluetooth interface for communicating with the Wavee Configurator mobile application.

The Wavee Configurator is a mobile application that can be used to configure a Wavee device, send commands to exercise functionality, update LCD images, and send firmware updates. The application can be found on the Apple App Store and Google Play.

### Privacy Statement

Bexar Technology Partners Inc. and Peak 8 Connected do not collect any data or usage statistics for Wavee Touchless Switches or the Wavee Configurator application. 

The Wavee Configurator application communicates only with Wavee Touchless Switch devices over a private Bluetooth Low Energy point-to-point connection for the purposes of customizing the behavior and performance of the switch device. No other data is exchanged and no other network connections are made.

# Zwave Smart Building Controller

The Zwave smart building controller is a public repository capturing the work I did for a Zwave home automation network. This is a Nodejs project that I run on a Raspberry Pi 4 to automate outdoor lights and other devices around the home. I developed it to evaluate the Zwave protocol for future possible implementation in a real product.
